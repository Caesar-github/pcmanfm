pcmanfm (0.3.5.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer(Closes:#454278)
  * New upstream release (Closes:#447229,#443988,#460574)
    - Fix incorrect title of windows.
    - Show icons of *.desktop files in every folder.
    - Slightly improve path entry.
    - Resolve paths with '~' and '.', '..' in command line arguments, if
      they are not expanded by shell.
    - Show lines in dir tree if gtk+ > 2.10.
    - Add drop down menu for "back" and "forward" buttons.
    - Open dir in new tab when middle clicking on dir tree.
    - Thumbnail support is re-written, and both the speed and stability
      are improved.
    - Completely re-written volume management, can mount/umount/eject
      volumes through HAL correctly now.
    - The underlying mime-type system was completely re-designed and
      re-written from scratch. Now it's faster, more robust, and more
      standard compliant. The memory usage was reduced, too. By
      installing a xml file to the shared-mime-database, mime-type
      detection was enhanced.
    - Add some new locales: tr, eu, ja
    - Folder views are correctly updated when files get deleted or
      created. Some FAM-related bugs were fixed.
    - Command line arguments handling was improved. Now you can open
      multiple files with pcmanfm through command line.
    - Correctly handle desktop directory in the side pane. (Get the
      path of desktop directory from ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. Hide the
      item if the directory didn't exist.)
    - config files were moved to ~/.config/pcmanfm to follow the new
      standard.
    - Better-looking about dialog, a must-have for every program. :p
    - Left click on the text of path bar with 'Ctrl' key held down now
      brings you to parent folders quickly. Here is a DEMO on youtube.
      http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=aGUOvSMWm6c
    - New shortcut keys are supported: Now both 'Alt+D' and 'Ctrl+L' can
      focus the path bar, and 'Backspace' brings you to parent folder.
    - Remove the useless "Address" label on the path bar.
    - Fix segfault in app chooser dialog.
    - Create dialog UI using new lightweight PtkUIXml system and
      *.glade files "without" libglade.
    - Decrease memory usage and size of executable file.
